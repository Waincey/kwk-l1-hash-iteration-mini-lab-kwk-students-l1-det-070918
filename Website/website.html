    <p><h2>When I got my rabbits</h2></p>
    <p><h3>I got my rabbits last September from the Humane Society. Originally, we went there to adopt this one Mini Lop rabbit that was orange and white and a few months old. By the time we got there though, he was already adopted. Because of this, we looked at the other rabbits that they had. My mom and brother wanted another Mini Lop that was black and 1 years old. I wanted a Mini Rex that was black and white and 1 years old. In the end, we ended up bringing both of them home.</h3></p>

    <p><h2>My Rabbit's Behavior</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Since both of my rabbits are boys, they don't get along really well. I think this is mostly the fault of the Mini Lop (Midnight aka Middy). Middy is a very aggressive rabbit that likes his territory. The other rabbit, the Mini Rex (Klark aka Klarky) is a more friendly rabbit that wants a friend. But becuase Middy is territorial, they do not get along. Klarky is more of a scardey cat and Middy is more of a independent rabbit. They both get along well with my dog, Coco. </h3></p>

    <p><h2>Rabbit's Destruction</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Before I had Middy and Klarky, I had another rabbit. She was a English Lop names Hopper. She passed a little while ago. Hopper was never so much trouble as my two newer rabbits. Klarky and Middy love to rip cardboard and flip over full bowls. They also love to find other ways to make a mess such as by knocking over things like pop. They also eat and poop so much more than Hopper. We think this is because Hopper was an older rabbit and always wanted to sleep instead of making a mess.</h3></p>
